# Reminder Extension for Azure DevOps

## Overview

The **Reminder Extension** is a powerful tool designed to help developers, operations teams, and project managers stay on top of important project-related tasks by allowing them to create, view, and manage reminders directly within Azure DevOps. Whether it's renewing tokens, updating passwords, uploading keys, or any other time-sensitive tasks, this app ensures you never miss a critical deadline.

In large projects, maintaining and tracking expiration dates for certificates, tokens, URLs, and other vital information can be a challenge. The Reminder App simplifies this process by providing a dedicated section in Azure DevOps where all reminders are securely stored. The tool operates entirely within Azure DevOps, ensuring your data is safe, secure, and not shared with any third-party services.

## Key Features

- **Create Reminders**: Users can create reminders for various project-related tasks, such as renewing certificates, updating passwords, or uploading security tokens.
- **Manage Reminders**: View and update reminders directly in the Azure DevOps **Code Hub** section. Add custom notes for each reminder to provide additional context and details.
- **Role-based Permissions**: 
  - **All users** with access to the project can create, view, and update reminders. 
  - Only **admin users** can delete reminders, ensuring that important information is not accidentally removed.
- **Security**: All reminder data is securely stored within Azure DevOps itself. The app does not rely on third-party APIs or storage services, ensuring your sensitive data remains private and safe.
- **Organization-wide Access**: Any user with access to the organization can view and manage reminders, making it easier for teams to collaborate and stay aligned.
- **Unlimited Reminders**: There's no limit to the number of reminders you can create, ensuring that even complex projects with many tasks can stay organized.

## Why Use the Reminder App?

In complex projects, it's common to have numerous tasks that need to be scheduled and tracked over time. This app provides a centralized solution for managing all reminders, so you can:
- Never miss important deadlines, such as certificate renewals, password updates, or token expirations.
- Keep your team aligned and informed about upcoming tasks and responsibilities.
- Store and manage reminders directly in the Azure DevOps environment without relying on external tools or services.
- Maintain a historical record of past reminders for future reference.

## How to Use the App

1. **Navigate to the Code Hub**: The Reminder App is integrated into the Azure DevOps Code Hub section, where you can manage all your reminders in one place.
2. **Create a Reminder**: Add a new reminder by specifying the task, the due date, and any additional notes. The system will automatically track the reminder until it is completed or deleted by an admin.
3. **View and Update**: All users can view and update existing reminders, providing flexibility in managing project tasks.
4. **Admin Control**: Only users with admin permissions can delete reminders, ensuring that critical tasks are not removed by mistake.

## Future Enhancements

We are constantly working to improve the Reminder App, and future updates may include features such as:
- **Email Notifications**: Automatically send reminder notifications to users before a task is due.
- **Custom Reminder Types**: Categorize reminders based on task type (e.g., security, maintenance, operations).
- **Integration with Pipelines**: Trigger actions in Azure DevOps pipelines based on reminder due dates.
